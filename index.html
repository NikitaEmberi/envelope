                            The first time we met, there wasn't that love-at-first-sight thing. 
                            But as time passed, I started falling for you, bit by bit. Your personality, 
                            your voice, your hair, the warmth you give off, your kindness, that hug of yours, 
                            the words you say, your sense of humor—all of it clicked. It hit me: you're exactly 
                            what I've been searching for. So, aashu bangaram, you truly are very precious to me 🤗✨ and I completely, genuinely, wholeheartedly,
                            (insert all the adverbs that fit here 😂, bcoz this is the height of creativity I could reach 🙂) నేను నిన్ను ప్రేమిస్తున్నాను 😘💖👑
